    This section is non-normative.
    HTML is the World Wide Webâ€™s core markup language. Originally,
    HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing
    scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted,
    over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents
    and even applications.
